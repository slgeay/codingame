# CodinGame: Spring Challenge 2023

## Goal

End the game with more crystal than your opponent.

The game takes place in a lab, in which two scientists in charge of robot ants are competing to find the most efficient way of gathering crystals.

However, the ants **cannot be controlled directly**. The ants will respond to the presence of beacons.
